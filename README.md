## **Design Choices**

### **Fonts**
The Fonts used are [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans) and [Lobster](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lobster). I have selected Lobster mainly for headlines as it brings an elegant and vintage element that is certainly related to the art of bartending. Open Sans is a perfect match as it is readable, dislexia friendly and also brings an element of versatility which is a very important bartending caracheristic.

### **Colours**
The idea behind the main colours was to use the match with the colours on the background image. Light orange to contrast and promote ease reading in contrast with white and black.
