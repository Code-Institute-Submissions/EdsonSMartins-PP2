## **Design Choices**
### **Fonts**
The Fonts used are [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans) and [Lobster](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lobster). I have selected Lobster mainly for headlines as it brings an elegant and vintage element that is certainly related to the art of bartending. Open Sans is a perfect match as it is readable, dislexia friendly and also brings an element of versatility which is a very important bartending caracheristic. 
### **Colours**
The idea behind the color palette was to use the very classic art decor reference connected to wood and gold elements such as wood barrels and golden shakers.
### **Wireframes**
The wireframes were created using [Figma](https://www.figma.com) and can be found in pdf form in [wireframes](documentation/wireframes)
